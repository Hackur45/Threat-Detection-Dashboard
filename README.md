## Uniqueness of Idea

- Combines **multimodal threat detection** across text, audio, and images into a single user-friendly platform.
- Audio files are converted to text and analyzed via Gorq AI for **threat probability**, **sentiment analysis**, **threat summary**, and **keyword detection**.
- Text and audio share the same analysis pipeline, ensuring high consistency and efficiency.
- Image uploads/captures are analyzed through Groq AI to generate **threat detection** and **recommendations**.
- **Threat levels** for text, audio, and image are visualized separately using **line graphs**, providing clear tracking of trends.
- **Previous threat data** powers insights like:
  - Threat frequency spikes,
  - Type of most frequent threats,
  - Severity patterns,
  - Source-wise threat contribution,
  - Top recurring threatening keywords.
- These insights help users **predict and prevent future threats proactively**, making the platform highly adaptive.

## Complexity

- Manages multiple input types — **audio**, **text**, and **image** — each requiring different pre-processing and analysis pipelines.
- Integrates real-time audio-to-text conversion, audio recording, image upload/capture, and backend ML model communication.
- Plots **separate threat level graphs** for text, audio, and images.
- Handles real-time sentiment trends and keyword tracking from the audio-text flow.
- **Threat history analytics** introduces added complexity by:
  - Analyzing frequency trends,
  - Mapping severity shifts,
  - Visualizing recurring keyword patterns,
  - Tracking recommendation effectiveness.
- Building such a **multi-layered, responsive dashboard** with live inputs, model outputs, and analytical visualizations requires high technical orchestration.
